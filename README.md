# Shelf for reddit

A modular theme for subreddits.

This theme contains elements inpired by a few other subreddits, along with some things made on the way.

Feel free to fork it and modify it however you want.

The `/styles/drrp` folder contains elements made specifically for a subreddit I manage, so you can delete it if you want to work with this stylesheet.
Remember to remove their references in `/styles/build.scss` too.
